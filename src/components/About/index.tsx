        I&apos;m a self-taught Frontend Developer ðŸ¤“ <br />
        I&apos;m head over heels with web-development, and for year and a half
        that I have been studying, this feeling has only grown. My main sources
        of knowledge are Jonas Schmedtmann&apos;s HTML & CSS and JavaScript
        courses, Colt Steele&apos;s React course, freeCodeCamp Responsive Web
        Design curriculum and the Rolling Scopes School JavaScript/Front-end
        course. ...And hundreds and hundreds of hours of Youtube videos &
        reading Stack Overflow ðŸ˜… <br /> I enjoy the process of learning new
        stuff, especially the moment of doing something that was difficult and
        unclear before. <br />
        Besides programming, I like music and going to the gym.
